      <h2>LEAN Program in WOM​​​​​​</h2>
      <p>The Lean program strenghtens the culture of continuous improvement and empowers staff to solve problems on a daily basis, creating business improvement opportunities with customers at the forefront of those opportunities.</p>
      <h3>Some Rules on Reporting Lean Outcomes</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>Any Lean improvement must be in the Lean Repository</li>
          <li>Lean improvements cannot eliminate headcount</li>
          <li>If an improvement has not been Money Belt verified by Finance, it cannot be used in the Business Plan</li>
          <li>The Lean Office provides all program stats (e.g. trained staff, cost savings, cost avoidance, projects completed</li>
      </ul>
