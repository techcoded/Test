              to create content for internal and external audiences to improve
              employee engagement and change perceptions. I have also used my

            <p>
              I am a passionate individual that have brought my passion into the
              meticulous art of brand management. I have managed the brands to
              ensuring consistency in the brand promise and positioning, but
              also in the brand execution of the brands including the deployment
              of logos, typographies, colors and tones. I have created identity
              manuals and brand usage guides.

              I have managed projects in my career, including rebreanding,
              events management, and change management. Most of these projects
              were in an agile environment but i am also familiar with the
              waterfall approach to project management which qualifies me as an
              all-round product manager.
